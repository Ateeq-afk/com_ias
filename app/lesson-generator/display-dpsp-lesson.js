    introduction: 'Understanding Directive Principles of State Policy is essential for mastering Polity in the UPSC examination. This concept forms the foundation for many advanced topics and frequently appears in both Prelims and Mains, particularly in questions related to governance, welfare state, and constitutional philosophy.',
    mainExplanation: `## Detailed Understanding: Directive Principles of State Policy

### 1. **Definition and Scope**
Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) are guidelines or principles given to the government for the governance of the country. These are fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the State to apply these principles in making laws. They are enshrined in Part IV of the Indian Constitution (Articles 36-51).

### 2. **Historical Evolution**
The concept of DPSP was borrowed from the Irish Constitution of 1937. The idea was first conceived by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and the Constituent Assembly debates show extensive discussion on their inclusion. The Irish model was preferred over other models because it balanced individual rights with collective welfare.

### 3. **Key Components**
DPSP can be classified into three broad categories:

**A. Socialist Principles (Articles 38-40, 43, 46-47)**
- Article 38: Promotion of welfare of people
- Article 39: Equal distribution of material resources
- Article 43: Living wages and decent standard of life
- Article 46: Promotion of educational and economic interests of SCs, STs
- Article 47: Improvement of public health and prohibition of intoxicating drinks

**B. Gandhian Principles (Articles 40, 43, 46, 48)**
- Article 40: Organization of village panchayats
- Article 43: Promotion of cottage industries
- Article 46: Educational and economic interests of weaker sections
- Article 48: Prohibition of cow slaughter

**C. Liberal Principles (Articles 44, 45, 48A, 49-51)**
- Article 44: Uniform Civil Code
- Article 45: Free and compulsory education (now Fundamental Right)
- Article 48A: Protection and improvement of environment
- Article 49: Protection of monuments and places of national importance
- Article 50: Separation of judiciary from executive
- Article 51: Promotion of international peace and security

### 4. **Theoretical Framework**
Scholars define DPSP as "positive directions" to the state to establish a welfare state, contrasting with Fundamental Rights which are "negative restrictions" on state power. They represent the philosophy of a welfare state and aim to establish economic and social democracy.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Non-justiciable (cannot be enforced by courts)
- Fundamental in governance
- Positive obligations on the state
- Aim to establish a welfare state
- Bridge between individual rights and collective good

### 5. **Contemporary Relevance**
In today's context, DPSP have gained renewed importance through judicial interpretation and legislative implementation:
- **Environmental Protection**: Article 48A has been the basis for environmental laws
- **Right to Education**: Article 45 became a Fundamental Right through 86th Amendment
- **Healthcare**: Article 47 guides public health policies like NRHM, Ayushman Bharat
- **Social Justice**: Articles 39 and 46 underpin affirmative action policies

### 6. **Challenges and Criticisms**
Major issues include:
- **Non-justiciable nature**: Cannot be enforced through courts directly
- **Resource constraints**: Implementation requires significant financial resources
- **Political will**: Depends on government priorities and political commitment
- **Conflict with Fundamental Rights**: Sometimes DPSP implementation may restrict individual rights
- **Lack of time-bound targets**: No specific deadlines for implementation

### 7. **Judicial Interpretation**
The Supreme Court has evolved the relationship between DPSP and Fundamental Rights through landmark cases:
- **Champakam Dorairajan case (1951)**: Fundamental Rights prevail over DPSP
- **Kesavananda Bharati case (1973)**: Both are complementary, not contradictory
- **Minerva Mills case (1980)**: Balance between individual rights and collective good
- **Recent trend**: Courts increasingly reference DPSP to interpret Fundamental Rights expansively`,
    examples: [
      'Historical Context: DPSP emerged during the freedom struggle when the Indian National Congress, through various resolutions including the Karachi Session (1931), outlined the socio-economic goals that independent India should pursue beyond mere political freedom.',
      'Practical Application: In modern India, DPSP are applied through policy formulation and legislative action. For example, the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) is based on Article 39 and 43, while environmental laws derive from Article 48A.',
      'Comparative Perspective: Unlike other countries where social and economic rights are often justiciable, India\'s approach through DPSP creates a unique balance where these principles guide governance without creating legal obligations that courts can directly enforce.'

          'Guidelines for governance that are fundamental but non-justiciable in nature',
          'Constitutional provisions that override Fundamental Rights in all circumstances',
          'Legal obligations that create binding duties on both state and citizens'
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: 'Option B is correct. DPSP are guidelines for governance that are fundamental in the governance of the country but are non-justiciable, meaning they cannot be directly enforced by courts.',

  summary: {
    keyTakeaways: [
      'DPSP are non-justiciable guidelines in Part IV (Articles 36-51) that direct state policy toward welfare state goals',
      'Three categories: Socialist principles (economic welfare), Gandhian principles (village economy), Liberal principles (individual liberty)',
      'Implementation occurs through legislation and policy (NREGA, RTI, Environmental laws) rather than direct judicial enforcement',
      'Judicial interpretation evolved from subordination to complementarity with Fundamental Rights through landmark cases',
      'Contemporary relevance in areas like environmental protection, social justice, and healthcare policy formulation'
    ],
    mnemonics: [
      'Remember DPSP categories: SGL (Socialist, Gandhian, Liberal principles)',
      'Key cases evolution: CKM (Champakam → Kesavananda → Minerva Mills)',
      'Implementation areas: HEALERS (Health, Education, Agriculture, Labour, Environment, Rural development, Social justice)'
    ],
    commonMistakes: [
      'Confusing DPSP with Fundamental Rights - DPSP are non-justiciable guidelines, not enforceable rights',
      'Thinking DPSP are subordinate to Fundamental Rights - modern interpretation sees them as complementary',
      'Missing the three-fold classification and their distinct philosophical bases',
      'Overlooking judicial evolution and contemporary implementation examples'
    ],
    examTips: [
      'Always mention the non-justiciable nature and Part IV location (Articles 36-51)',
      'Use specific examples of implementation (NREGA for Article 39, Environmental laws for 48A)',
      'Reference landmark cases when discussing DPSP-Fundamental Rights relationship',
      'Connect DPSP to current government policies and welfare schemes for contemporary relevance'
