    introduction: 'Understanding Fundamental Rights is essential for mastering Polity in the UPSC examination. This concept forms the foundation for many advanced topics and frequently appears in both Prelims and Mains.',
    mainExplanation: `## Detailed Understanding: Fundamental Rights

### 1. **Definition and Scope**
Fundamental Rights refer to the basic human rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India to all citizens. These rights are considered fundamental because they are essential for the development of the personality of every individual and to preserve human dignity.

### 2. **Historical Evolution**
The concept of fundamental rights in India drew inspiration from the Bill of Rights in the US Constitution. The Karachi Session (1931) of the Indian National Congress first outlined fundamental rights, which later found place in the Constitution.

### 3. **Key Components**
The Constitution originally provided for seven fundamental rights, but the Right to Property was removed by the 44th Amendment Act, 1978. Currently, there are six fundamental rights:

- **Right to Equality (Articles 14-18)**
- **Right to Freedom (Articles 19-22)**  
- **Right against Exploitation (Articles 23-24)**
- **Right to Freedom of Religion (Articles 25-28)**
- **Cultural and Educational Rights (Articles 29-30)**
- **Right to Constitutional Remedies (Article 32)**

### 4. **Theoretical Framework**
Scholars define fundamental rights as those basic rights which are essential for the all-round development of individuals. These rights are:
- Justiciable (enforceable by courts)
- Fundamental to human existence
- Protected against arbitrary state action
- Subject to reasonable restrictions

### 5. **Contemporary Relevance**
In today's context, fundamental rights serve as bulwarks against authoritarian tendencies and ensure democratic governance. Recent developments like the right to privacy (recognized by Supreme Court in 2017) show their evolving nature.

### 6. **Challenges and Criticisms**
Major issues include:
- Conflict between individual rights and collective good
- Reasonable restrictions often becoming unreasonable
- Difficulty in enforcement for marginalized sections
- Balancing rights with duties`,
    examples: [
      'Historical Context: Fundamental Rights emerged during the freedom struggle when the Indian National Congress, in its Karachi Session (1931), outlined the basic rights that citizens should enjoy in free India.',
      'Practical Application: In modern India, Fundamental Rights are applied through judicial review, where courts can strike down laws that violate these rights, as seen in the Kesavananda Bharati case (1973).',
      'Comparative Perspective: Unlike other countries, India\'s approach to Fundamental Rights balances individual liberty with social justice, incorporating both negative rights (freedom from state interference) and positive rights (state obligation to provide certain facilities).'
