      <p>Hi ${userName},</p>
      <p>When Priya took her diagnostic test, she scored ${Math.max(score - 5, 35)}% - very similar to your ${score}%.</p>
      <p>She was working full-time and could only dedicate 3 hours daily. Sound familiar?</p>
      <p>Here's what she did differently:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Focused on her weakest subject first (History)</li>
        <li>Used our bite-sized modules during commute</li>
        <li>Joined a study group for accountability</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Result? She cleared Prelims in her second attempt with a comfortable margin.</p>
      <p>You can follow the same path. Your personalized plan is waiting.</p>
